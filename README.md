## What is Kirby?
Kirby is an flexible and lightweight file-based CMS, developed by [Bastian Allgeier.](http://bastianallgeier.com)**

## How I can use it?
You have to download **[Kirby](http://getkirby.com)** and the theme. After this replace assets, content and site folder with the downloaded files.

Read the **[documentation](http://getkirby.com/docs)** by Kirby. Don't be scared, it's so **simple**!

## Change the color
You can change the color of your theme (headlines,links) really simple.

(image: variable.png)
Go to assets/css/style.scss, open it and replace the colorcode at the variable "$maincolor" with your own. After that copy all the code, open the website [Sass-Lang.com](http://sass-lang.com/try.html) and insert your code. 

Click the button "Render" and copy the code at the bottom. Now you have to open the style.css and replace the code with yours.
