## What is Kirby?
Kirby is an flexible and lightweight file-based CMS, developed by (link: http://bastianallgeier.com text:Bastian Allgeier.)

## How I can use it?
You must download (link: http://getkirby.com text:Kirby) and the theme. After this replace  assets, content and site folder with the downloaded files.

Read the (link:http://getkirby.com/docs text:documentation) by Kirby. Don't be scary, it's so **simple**!

## Change the color
You can change the color of your theme (headlines,links) really simple.

(image: variable.png)
Go to assets/css/style.scss, open it and replace the colorcode at the variable "$maincolor" with your own. After that copy all the code, open the website (link:http://sass-lang.com/try.html text:"Sass-Lang.com") and insert your code. 

Click at the button "Render" and copy the code at the bottom. Now you must open the style.css and replace the code with yours.
